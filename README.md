Holonet has many features, but it is designed to handle mail as long as the management command mail_handler can connect to the database. Services like rabbitmq, elasticsearch, celery, omnibus and policy_services are not required to handle valid mail, but the bounce, spam and blacklist services may not work properly. Postfix may require services like spamassasin and the policy_service to work properly. This depends on your postfix config. If spamassasin is down postfix will send a bounce message to the sender. Postfix may work without the policy_service if a default value exist in the postfix config, if not send a bounce. The sender will get a bounce if something goes wrong under the mail_handler, mail_handler raises different exit codes based on the result.

### Features
* Index spam, blacklisted and bounce mail in Elasticsearch
* Policy Service
* Handle mail using pipe
* Mapping API (Create / Edit / Delete mappings using a json REST API.)
* Store statistics in Elasticsearch
* Stats frontend
* Restricted mail

## Pipeline
1. Postfix (Recipient validation uses Holonet Policy Service)
2. Spamassasin
3. Postfix Pipe (Holonet Mail Handling)
4. Holonet does a mailinglist lookup and uses sendmail to process mail to it's recipients

## Getting started
```
git clone git@github.com:webkom/holonet.git
cd holonet
npm install && bower install
make frontend
make venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements/prod.txt
```

Now you need to fix the settings file. Override the settings you want in settings/holonet.py.
Make sure you configure the database, elasticsearch config, celery broker, cache and so on.

```
python manage.py collectstatic
```

The django project is now probably ready to run. You can now run it with gunicorn or uwsgi. 
Now you need to setup postfix to pipe mail into holonet, start the policy service and start the celery worker. This process is described later in this document.

It is recomended to run the scripts with supervisor.

## Holonet Celery Worker
This worker executes tasks asynchronous. Holonet may work without it, but it is recomended to run it.
```
$PROJECT_DIR/venv/bin/python $PROJECT_DIR/manage.py celery worker
```

## Holonet Policy Service
Holonet Policy Service does a lookup in the mailing lists to find if the RCPT TO parameter is handeled by Holonet.

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
```
smtpd_relay_restrictions =
        permit_mynetworks
        permit_sasl_authenticated
        defer_unauth_destination
        check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:13000
```
Then start the policy service with the management command:
```
$PROJECT_DIR/venv/bin/python $PROJECT_DIR/manage.py policy_service
```
## Postfix Setup
Postfix needs to accept all recipients:

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
```
luser_relay = $LOCALUSER
local_recipient_maps =
```
Postfix needs to know the destination domains:

```
mydestination = holonet.abakus.no, localhost.abakus.no, localhost, abakus.no
```

## Holonet Mail Handler
Postfix needs to know where to deliver local mails:

/etc/postfix/main.cf
```
local_transport = holonet
holonet_destination_recipient_limit = 1
```
/etc/postfix/master.cf
```
holonet    unix    -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  user=$LOCALUSER argv=$PROJECT_DIR/venv/bin/python $PROJECT_DIR/manage.py mail_handler ${sender} ${recipient}
```

## Spamassasin Support
Install Spamassasin
```
apt-get install spamassassin spamc
groupadd spamd
useradd -g spamd -s /bin/false -d /var/log/spamassassin spamd
mkdir /var/log/spamassassin
chown spamd:spamd /var/log/spamassassin
```
Set up Spamassasin

Change /etc/default/spamassassin (Just change the listed parameters)
```
ENABLED=1
CRON=1
OPTIONS="--create-prefs --max-children 5 --helper-home-dir --ipv4only"
```
Change /etc/spamassassin/local.cf (Just change the listed parameters)
```
rewrite_header Subject ***** SPAM _SCORE_ :: Holonet Mail Service *****
report_safe 0
required_score 3.0
use_bayes 1
bayes_auto_learn 1
add_header ham HAM-Report _REPORT_
```
